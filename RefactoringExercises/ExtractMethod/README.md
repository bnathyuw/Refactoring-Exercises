EXTRACT METHOD
==============

BACKGROUND
----------

This code sample is designed to let you practise applying the Extract Method refactoring.

The class to refactor, UltimateQuestion, is designed to find the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. Fortunately, with the application of Moore's Law, this no longer takes 7.5 million years, and can be run on an ordinary desktop computer.

The tests in ExtractMethodTests confirm that finding this answer involves thinking long and hard, and that the answer generated is always 42.
